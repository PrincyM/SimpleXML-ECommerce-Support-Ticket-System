# SimpleXML-ECommerce-Support-Ticket-System
I have used PHP SimpleXML to manipulate XML data and build this CRUD Support Ticket System to store data from XML. 

A ticket booking System where user details are stored in users.xml file and tickets in tickets.xml file. User credentials are stored in the users.xml file and fetched from the XML during login and lead the user to their resepective dashboard i.e. client or staff. 

Staff members have all privileges where they can view, edit all the tickets submitted by any client as well as send messages to clients on existing tickets. However, clients can only create a new support ticket, view their existing tickets in queue and send messages to staff to follow up on existing tickets.
